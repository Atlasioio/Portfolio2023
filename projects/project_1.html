        <h1>Social Media Project</h1>
        <h2 class="h2_text">Background</h2>
        <p class=about_text>
            In the course <a href="https://mau.se/en/study-education/course/kd400b/" target=_blank class="hyperlink">
                Methods 1</a> we were tasked to undertake a project to get familiar with the "typical human-centred
                 design process of research, identifying insights, setting the problem, ideating and evaluating". The
                 project itself was about social media. We picked the theme of dating apps in Sweden.
                 After researching, ideating, sketching and desgining, we eventually redesigned a new feature for Tinder,
                  called Tinder Event. A few short weeks later Tinder themselves came out with a feature called "explore"
                  which has a lot of the same ideas as our suggested feature.

        </p>

        <h2 class="h2_text">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="about_text">
            How can tinder be redesigned to bring people with similar interests together in a fun way that keeps the Tinder perona?
        </p>

        <h2 class="h2_text">Design Opportunity</h2>
        <p class="about_text">
           Design a dating app feature that "matches" people with the event they are interested in. Keeps the essence of tinder
           with having swiping and solves makes it a lot more convienent to meet people interested in the same things as the user, 
           be it going to a football game or game night.
        </p>
